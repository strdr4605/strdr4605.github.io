# Projects

Here is a list of projects (which are still alive) that I created or contributed to.
All of them are open-source, so you can also check how I write code ðŸ˜….
Some of them need improvements, so if you are willing to contribute, contact me.

1. **[mockingcase](https://github.com/strdr4605/mockingcase)**: node package that converts a string to mOcKiNgCaSe
It may be a not very useful package, but while working on it I learned a lot, and still consider it as amazing piece of software.
More about it [here](https://strdr4605.github.io/my-first-open-source-project).

1. **[roataway.md](https://roataway.md)**: Open-source app, that displays real-time positions of public transport.

1. **[@strdr4605/eslint-plugin-react-props-destructuring](https://github.com/strdr4605/eslint-plugin-react-props-destructuring)**: A very opinionated rule for ReactJS props destructuring. See discussion [here](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/pull/3086).
