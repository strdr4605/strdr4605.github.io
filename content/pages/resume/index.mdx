I am passionate about IT.
I am a team player and always aim for teamwork, code review, documentation, discussions whether it is a complex project or a project just for fun.
My hobbies are Hackathons and IT events, where I exchange my experience with people and learn new professional and personal skills.
I also like mentoring and helping people in software engineering. <br/>
I share my experience on [strdr4605.github.io](https://strdr4605.github.io).

## Experience

- `02.11.2020-PRESENT` **[Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/)** | Front End Engineer (Customer Cloud Security)  <br/>
My team owns and operates the first line of defense for Amazon's confidential customer data. <br/>
I am responsible for a _React Native_ library that encrypts and decrypts sensitive data through the network. <br/>
I worked on integration tests for the decryption library on the Amazon website and eliminated 10 man-hours/week. <br/>
- `20.12.2018–04.09.2020` **[GoParrot.ai](https://www.goparrot.ai/)** | Online Ordering Platform on Microservices Architecture <br/>
I was responsible for a white-label mobile product with 7+ apps.<br/>
I wrote automation scripts, design proposals, project documentation, and configured to development flow.<br/>
I worked on a new version of the Platform using _React Native_/_ReactJS_ with 40%+ code shared between mobile and web.<br/>
I worked on a service that synchronizes the database with partners _APIs_ and reduced manual work from 1 week to 15 minutes.<br/>

> A big part of my professional experience comes from [**39 Hackathons**](https://strdr4605.github.io/what-i-learned-from-35-hackathons) where I developed front-end/back-end/mobile apps and games. Also, I contribute to **30+ open-source projects**.

- **[mockingcase](https://github.com/strdr4605/mockingcase)**: I created and maintain a _Node.js_ package that converts a string to `mOcKiNgCaSe`. Friendly documentation, unit tests, jsdoc and types for _TypeScript_. I write feature requirements and documentation, review pull requests, and guide 15+ first-time contributors on open-source.
- **[jump2header](https://github.com/strdr4605/jump2header)**: I created a tool that adds markdown links to improve navigation in long README.md files on Github. Used in several popular open-source projects like [exceljs](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) and others.
- **[redux-requests](https://github.com/klis87/redux-requests)**: Redux addon to simplify handling of AJAX requests.
I added the [promise driver](https://github.com/klis87/redux-requests/tree/master/packages/redux-requests-promise), set up the documentation site with [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and participated in discussions about library design.
- **[@goparrot/react-native-geometry-utils](https://github.com/goparrot/react-native-geometry-utils)**: I created a _React Native_ library that exposes google maps geometry utils.
- **[roataway.md](https://roataway.md)**: Open source app, that displays real-time positions of public transport.
I added features like [vehicle off-route updates, render vehicles as "off", marker drift on zoom](https://github.com/roataway/roataway-web/commits?author=strdr4605).
- **[spacebook](https://tum-faf.github.io/spacebook)**: At [NASA Hackathon 2019](https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/invent-your-own-challenge/invent-your-own-challenge/teams/spacebook/project) my team and I created a _Progressive Web App_ which shows [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) in an infinite scroll feed. A (not perfect) app that works by these days.
