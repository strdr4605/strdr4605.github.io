My daily rutine is to stay in front of the laptop and type. I knew I was slow at typing but it was ok for me.
Till the moments when I was typing in front of someone. Ony at that time I trully understood how slow I type.

At same time I new that I will never be a fast typer because I have a weak right hand.
70% of the keyboard is dominated by my left hand, and even then I have to type U,I,O,P,J,K,L,M the movement and accuracy of my right hand very bad.
But I decided to give it a try and see how my typing speed will encrise.

So let's see how what is my initial speed.

## Day 0 test

Taking 1 minute [typingtest](https://www.typingtest.com) with medium text I got 27 WPM (words per minute) with 100% accuracy.
Pretty bad comparing to average speed of 40 WPM of an avery person.

## Researching speed typing

First of all I understood that you need to type with all fingers and use so called HOME row position (putting your fingers on A,S,D,F,J,K,L).
Next is to learn touch typing which means typing with looking at the keyboard.
I started practicing on https://www.keybr.com

The mistake that I did was focusing on the speed instead of accuracy.
But in the real world the key to speed typing is accuracy as you don't want to spend time on backspacing and correcting you mistakes.
Then I started to learn again how to type focusing on pressing the correct key with the correct finger.

I learned how to touch type and even sometimes I was getting 35-40 WPM.
But again https://www.keybr.com is focusing on learning specific letter at the time of those lucky tests I was not moving my right hand that much.


## Day 7 test Touch typing

Taking 1 minute [typingtest](https://www.typingtest.com) with medium text I got 21 WPM (words per minute) with 91% accuracy.
As you can see writing real words with all letter is a bit harder that typing with only specific letters.
Although I learned touch typing and plan to stick with this aproach and let the muscle memory build up.

## New keyboard

I understood that I need a separate keyboard to get away from the screen
and have possibility to even work at a standing desk with my laptop lifted on a stand.

I decided to get a mechanical keyboard because I always wanted to try one.
After a long research I decided to buy AKKO 3084.

Switching to a mechanical keyboard I noticed that while doing touch typing I am not that good at it as on my laptop keyboard.
Thy keyboard is lifted compared to my laptop and because of linear switches with small activation point I do a lot of typos.
Although I like the keyboard and will use it for now, as a suggestion, I would buy tactile switches as the first mechanical keyboard.
