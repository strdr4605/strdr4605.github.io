When I decided to create a personal website for blogging I picked [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) because it was trandy at that time and it is a great solution for static sites. I seached for a minimalistic template and found [LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog), amazing theme with a lot of features.

I was happy with it, but over time I started changing the theme, so much that it became almost a custom one. You can check it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210714134946/https://strdr4605.github.io/).

I was thinking about creating a new website using [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) as I wanted to play with it, but I did not really like any available themes.

I attempted several times to clone and play with Next.JS templates, but after understanding how many features I need, I thought that it will take a lot of time to build from scratch.

## Final decision

While writing a new acticle I was getting ofter an annoying error when dev server was refreshing the page.

> [TypeError: Cannot read property 'title' of null](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/issues/589)

Force page refresh did not help. The only way to get rid of the error was restarting the dev server.
The maintainer releases a new version of the theme with Gatsby v3, but when trying to update, I did not succeed.

Also I decided to buy strdr4605.com domain, so starting with a new website was a good idea.

## How I started

Inspired by https://bearblog.dev/ minimalistic blog I decided to start with a basic example and first add all required features, then thinking about design.

Features:

- `.mdx` _(later I went `.md` as I was not really using `.mdx` features)_
- Slug from post title _(I did not want to break old links)_
- Generate Open Graph image from title _(for link preview)_
- RSS Feed _(as some of my followers may use [CoFeed-19](https://cofeed-19.github.io/))_

I started following [Next.JS Basic example](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) and got [435 points âœ¨](https://twitter.com/strdr4605/status/1485390442518753280).

## Challenges

The problems started appearing quickly.

Firstly, my content structure was:

```bash
|____content
| |____posts
| | |____post-folder
| | | |____index.mdx
| | | |____image-from-post.jpg
```

But Next.JS has this:

```bash
|____posts
| |____post-slug.md
|____public
| |____image-from-post.jpg
```

I had to [rename mdx to md](https://www.emgoto.com/md-to-mdx-rename/) and decided to fix images later.

Secondly, the post slug should be generated from title, but there is no simple way to pass both slug and post folder location.

Had to do a hack with a generated cache file with (slug, folder) map.
