Here is a list of projects that I created or contributed to.
All of them are open-source, so you can also check how I write code 😅.
Some of them need improvements, so if you are willing to contribute, contact me.

## Still alive

1. **[CoFeed-19](https://cofeed-19.github.io)**: Client-only Feed Reader, Free, No tracking, Minimalist.
   I created a free minimalistic Client-only Feed Reader to track my favorite blogs.

1. **[why](https://github.com/strdr4605/why)**: A tool to document your package.json scripts.

1. **[symlink-config](https://github.com/strdr4605/symlink-config)**: A tool to make your JavaScript repos cleaner by symlinking your project config files to root.

1. **[mockingcase](https://github.com/strdr4605/mockingcase)**: node package that converts a string to mOcKiNgCaSe
   It may be a not very useful package, but while working on it I learned a lot, and still consider it as an amazing piece of software.
   More about it [here](https://strdr4605.github.io/my-first-open-source-project).

1. **[redux-requests](https://github.com/klis87/redux-requests)**: Redux addon to simplify handling of AJAX requests.
   I added the [promise driver](https://github.com/klis87/redux-requests/tree/master/packages/redux-requests-promise), set up the documentation site with [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and participated in discussions about library design.

1. **[tt](https://github.com/strdr4605/tt)**: Command-line time tracker written in shell script
   [Why and How](https://strdr4605.github.io/building-a-command-line-time-tracker) I built this tool.

1. **[wtt](https://github.com/strdr4605/wtt)**: Mobile-first web app for sharing time availability across timezones. Mark slots, copy formatted text.

1. **[jump2header](https://github.com/strdr4605/jump2header)**: add "jump to" links for markdown headers
   Used in several popular open-source projects like [exceljs](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs), [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/blob/master/docs/Reference.md) and others.

1. **[@strdr4605/eslint-plugin-react-props-destructuring](https://github.com/strdr4605/eslint-plugin-react-props-destructuring)**: A very opinionated rule for ReactJS props destructuring. See discussion [here](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/pull/3086).

1. **[WHO AM I](https://strdr4605.github.io/whoami-ar)**: At BEST Hackathon 2021, my team and I created an _Augmented Reality_ game. Play it with your friends.

1. **[Spacebook](https://tum-faf.github.io/spacebook)**: At [NASA Hackathon 2019](https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/invent-your-own-challenge/invent-your-own-challenge/teams/spacebook/project) my team and I created a _Progressive Web App_ which shows [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) in an infinite scroll feed. A (not perfect) app that works by these days.

1. **[Extinction Map](https://tum-faf.github.io/extinction-map/)**: At FAF Hackathon 2020, my team and I created a web app that shows a map with the timeline of animals that became extinct.

1. **[fucking-nothing](https://github.com/strdr4605/fucking-nothing)**: a trolling project that looks like nothing but it's not.

1. **[issue-branch-action](https://github.com/strdr4605/issue-branch-action)**: Github action that comments on an issue when a related branch is created.

1. **[Fracfik](https://strdr4605.github.io/fracfik/)**: At my first Hackathon, we created a game that helps kids to learn fraction operations.

## Somehow dead

1. **[roataway.md](https://roataway.md)**: Open-source app, that displays real-time positions of public transport.
   I added features like [vehicle off-route updates, render vehicles as "off", marker drift on zoom](https://github.com/roataway/roataway-web/commits?author=strdr4605).
   
2. **[@goparrot/react-native-geometry-utils](https://github.com/goparrot/react-native-geometry-utils)**: Google maps geometry utils for react-native
   I worked with React Native Modules and wrote some Kotlin and Swift. There are non-async replacements for this library, but it's still [used](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@goparrot/react-native-geometry-utils).

  > Archived because we found the same functionality without the native bridge.

3. **[999 Plus](https://github.com/strdr4605/999-plus)**: Extension for sorting [999.md](https://999.md) items.

  > Sorting was added to the site, but the extension is still useful to remove booster posts.

4. **[@strdr4605/react-native-rename](https://github.com/strdr4605/react-native-rename)**: A fork of react-native-rename@2.4.1 with several improvements. Archived now.

  > Archived because the original library finally added the missing features.
