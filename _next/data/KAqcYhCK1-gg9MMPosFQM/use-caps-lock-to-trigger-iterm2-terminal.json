Till these days I was using <code>`</code> key as a hotkey. But when having to input <code>`</code> in markdown or JS I had to use <code>Option + ` </code> which has specific behavior.</p>\n<p>I decided to try Caps Lock for a while (as Caps Lock is one of the useless keys on the keyboard).</p>\n<p>The issue is that iTerm2 does not recognize the Caps Lock press. So I have to remap in MacOS Caps Lock to Control key.</p>\n<p>Go to <strong>System Preferences > Keyboard</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select Modifier Keys:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/macos-keyboard-mod-keys.png\" alt=\"macos keyboard mod keys\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Set Caps Lock as Control key:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/macos-caps-lock-ctrl.png\" alt=\"macos caps lock ctrl\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p>Go to iTerm, <strong>System Preferences > Profiles > Select profile > Keys > Configure Hotkey Window</strong>:\n<img src=\"/iterm-add-hotkey.png\" alt=\"iterm add hotkey\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set Double-tap key as Control</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/iterm-ctrl-hotkey.png\" alt=\"iterm ctrl hotkey\"></p>\n<p>Now when you double press Caps Lock (or Ctrl) the iTerm window will popup.</p>\n"},"_superjson":{"values":{"postData.date":["Date"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
