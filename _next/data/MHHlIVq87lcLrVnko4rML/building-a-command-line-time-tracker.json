Most of them were written in Python, but for me, the features were too much.\nI also found NodeJS packages, and one written in C that was way too simple as I need time in hours and minutes (not only seconds).</p>\n<p>Don't know why but my initial thought was that a command-line time tracker should be implemented in shell script.\nI found <a href=\"https://labs.tomasino.org/time-tracker-in-bash/\">Time tracker in Bash</a> and I liked the features but there was no instruction on how to install,\nand while trying the script was throwing some error (maybe was not compatible with macOS).</p>\n<p>I decided to write one myself in shell script, as an idea that it can be used on any unix system, without the need to have Python, C or NodeJS installed.\nI thought that it may take 4-5 hours to finish the first version.\nI decided to call the command <code class=\"language-unknown\">tt</code> (from time tracker), as it's short to type and start working.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>First I started with a hello world script, and then I noticed something I use but I am not 100% sure why.\nI am talking about the first line of most command-line scripts <code class=\"language-unknown\">#!/usr/bin/env bash</code>. Why it's needed?\nAfter a search, I found that it's called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29\">Shebang</a>.\nI decided that I will put the link and explanation at the beginning of the file,\nso people who may want to contribute or just see the implementation, will also know why this line is really needed.</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token shebang important\">#!/usr/bin/env sh</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># First 2 chars in the file are called Shebang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># In this case:</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">#   Execute this file with a \"sh\" interpreter, using the \"env\" program search path to find it.</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Now you know!</span>\n\n<span class=\"token function-name function\">tt</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Requirements are simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start an activity</li>\n<li>Stop an activity</li>\n<li>Log an activity and time spent (in hours and minutes)</li>\n<li>Clean history</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a first idea, we need two files:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code class=\"language-unknown\">~/.tt_logs</code> - will store all the logs.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-unknown\">~/.tt_session</code> - will instore info about current activity started time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The session file will have <code class=\"language-unknown\">start_time</code> and <code class=\"language-unknown\">activity_name</code>. <br/>\nTime will be stored in sec using <code class=\"language-unknown\">date +%s</code> which will return <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time\">Unix time</a>.</p>\n<p>Basic writing to a file with shell script is simple.</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"start_time=\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">></span> ~/.tt_session\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"activity_name=\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">>></span> ~/.tt_session\n</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-unknown\">&#x26;gt;</code> redirection operator writes <code class=\"language-unknown\">&#x26;quot;start_time=&#x26;quot;</code> to a given file.

Be extra careful when using this operator as you may overwrite an important file.</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-unknown\">&#x26;gt;&#x26;gt;</code> redirection operator appends the output to a given file. The file is created if it does not exist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When finishing an activity the script should read the data from the session file and write it into the logs file.\nThere are multiple options to read from a file. After a lot of testing, I found a way that works for my case.</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token assign-left variable\">start_time</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token variable\"><span class=\"token variable\">$(</span><span class=\"token function\">grep</span> <span class=\"token string\">'start_time='</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"<span class=\"token variable\">$TT_SESSION</span>\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">sed</span> -E <span class=\"token string\">\"s/.*start_time=([0-9]+).*/<span title=\"\\\\\" class=\"token entity\">\\\\</span>1/\"</span><span class=\"token variable\">)</span></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>To be honest, I don't like the solution, and I am sure you too, but I didn't want to spend more time on this.\nYou are welcome to contribute with a better one.</p>\n<p>After 3 or 4 hours I understood that it will take more time to create this script as new use cases appeared.\nWhat if I want to pause the activity, or maybe abort without logs?</p>\n<p>While thinking about how to solve new use cases I also asked myself: Isn't it too much time spent on this script?\nWhy just don't use Python solutions with richer features (like starting an activity in past).\nBut I decided to push it to the end as while spending time on this I learned something new, and also if I will need more features I will just add them later.</p>\n<p>Current functionality</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">tt - time tracker\n\nTracks activity time with a simple start/stop syntax.
