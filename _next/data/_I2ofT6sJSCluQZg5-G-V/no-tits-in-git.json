A new indentation and a bigger <strong>tit</strong>. Now it's harder to understand the git history.\nAnd it can get worse, and in one moment when you need to debug something and use git history, you see over 9000 tits, small, big, enormous, gigantic.</p>\n<p>I asked a friend of mine whats this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"git-carpet.png\" alt=\"Git carpet\"></p>\n<p>And he told me that it's a photo of my grandma's carpet ðŸ˜‚.</p>\n<p>But actually, it's a git history from a development team of my friend. Here is a zoom out:</p>\n<p><img src=\"gigantic-git-tits.jpg\" alt=\"Gigantic git tits\"></p>\n<p>You may say <em>\"I don't look at git history, I don't even use the command line, I only click the magic button on my IDE when I want to push my changes and everything is ok\"</em>.\nSure, it's ok until the moment when things become complicated.\nMaybe you need to get some changes from another branch, or maybe you need only one commit from your teammate's branch.\nYou may have some conflicts when merging/rebasing a wrong branch using your magic IDE.\nMaybe you need to find a bug that was introduced some time ago and the only way to understand where approximately it was is by looking at git history.\nYou may spend hours, days trying to navigate in a dimension full of <strong>tits</strong>.</p>\n<p>The main causes of git <strong>tits</strong> are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No desire to learn git a bit</li>\n<li>Using magic IDE buttons</li>\n<li>Using <strong>\"Merge pull request\"</strong> option button in Github PRs</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n<p>Use <code>git rebase</code> always!</p>\n<p>Here is a version of the git history above if it was done using <code>git rebase</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">* 461db4e <span class=\"token function\">add</span> circles\n* ad0041c Setting better colors <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> rectangles\n* 40446a6 fixed readme typo\n* b894618 <span class=\"token function\">add</span> readme to lab2, modified cases methods <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> bussiness logic\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>ðŸŽ‰ Now it's cleaner what is happening in the project.\nIf rebasing on every feature or bug fix, the git history will look like a straight line with some branches on top.\nIt will be easier to understand the status of the project and what git operations should be done.\nEasier to get some changes from other branches, or to find a bug that from past commits.</p>\n<p>You may think, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26582912\">rebasing is lying about the project history</a> and it's true.\nWhen rebasing you reapply the commits and now they have different hashes and committing dates/authors.\nYou will lose info about the branch name that was merged, or when these changes were initially committed.\nIf this is more important for you then yeah git <strong>gits</strong> is the way to go.\nBut I think about git history, not like some timeline of the project development where changes happened and I need all details,\nbut more like a version history of the project where every commit is a new version.\nThen I don't care about dates, hashes, authors. I only know that this version of the project (commit 2) comes after another version (commit 1).</p>\n<p>So, how to eliminate git <strong>tits</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use <code>git rebase</code> instead of <code>git merge</code> (or use <code>git merge --ff-only</code>)</li>\n<li>Use <code>git pull -r</code> (will do <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git rebase</code>) when getting updates from remote</li>\n<li>Use <strong>Rebase and merge</strong> option button in Github when merging PRs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The only case where we can not escape from git <strong>tit</strong> is doing a rebase with a lot of commits (20+) and you have to resolve conflicts at every other commit.\nThis can be a pain, especially when in the process of rebasing you did a mistake and the only way to revert it is to rebase again.\nIn this case <code>git merge</code> will let you solve all the conflicts in one take.</p>\n<p>I hope you understood my idea and from now on instead of confusing git <strong>tits</strong> and spaghetti, your project git history will look more like a beautiful palm tree.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let me know if there are other use cases when git <strong>tits</strong> are inevitable</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may also check <a href=\"/how-i-use-git\">how I use git</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n"},"_superjson":{"values":{"postData.date":["Date"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
