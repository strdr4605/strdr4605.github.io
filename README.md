## Personal Profile
I study Computer Science in the last year of university. I am passionate about IT. I am a team player and always aim for teamwork, code review, documentation, discussion whether it is a complex project or a project just for fun. Also, I like any events related to IT where I can discover something new and exchange my experience with people. My hobby is Hackathons, where I learned and still learn new professional and personal skills.
