I am passionate about IT. I am a team player and always aim for teamwork, code review, documentation, discussion whether it is a complex project or a project just for fun. My hobbies are Hackathons and IT events, where I exchange my experience with people and learn new professional and personal skills. I also like mentoring and helping people on software engineering.

## Experience

- `20.12.2018–PRESENT` **[GoParrot.ai](https://www.goparrot.ai/)** | Online Ordering Platform on _Microservices Architecture_  
I am resposable for a white-label mobile product with 7+ apps.  
My team and I work on new version of the Platform using _React-Native_/_ReactJS_ with 40%+ code shared between mobile and web.  
I worked on a service that synchronize database with parteners _APIs_ and reduced manual work from 1 week to 15 minutes.  

> A big part of my professional experience comes from **35 Hackathons** where I developed front-end/back-end/mobile apps and games. Also, I contribute to some open source projects.

- **[mockingcase](https://github.com/strdr4605/mockingcase)**: I created and maintain a _Node.js_ package that converts a string to `mOcKiNgCaSe`. Friendly documentation, unit tests, jsdoc and types for _TypeScript_. I write feature requirements and documentation, review pull requests and guide 15+ first-time contributors on open-source.
- **[jump2header](https://github.com/strdr4605/jump2header)**: I created a tool that adds markdown links to improve navigation in long README.md files on Github. Used in several popular open-source projects like [exceljs](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) and others.
- **[redux-requests](https://github.com/klis87/redux-requests)**: Redux addon to simplify handling of AJAX requests.  
I added the [promise driver](https://github.com/klis87/redux-requests/tree/master/packages/redux-requests-promise), setup the documentation site with [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and partipated in discussions about library design.
- **[rebble.io](https://rebble.io)**: I created a pull request on Github repo and using JavaScript and _CSS_, I converted _SVG static watch logo_ into _Easter egg real-time clock_. The hardest part was understanding how SVG works.
- **[spacebook](https://tum-faf.github.io/spacebook/)**: At [NASA Hackathon 2019](https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/invent-your-own-challenge/invent-your-own-challenge/teams/spacebook/project) my team and I created a _Progressive Web App_ which shows [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) in an infinite scroll feed. A (not perfect) app that works by these days.
