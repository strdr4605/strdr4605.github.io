## Personal Profile
I study Computer Science and I'm expected to graduate in June 2019. I am passionate about IT. I am a team player and always aim for teamwork, code review, documentation, discussion whether it is a complex project or a project just for fun. Also, I like any events related to IT where I can discover something new and exchange my experience with people. My hobby is Hackathons, where I learned and still learn new professional and personal skills.

## Experience
Mainly my professional experience comes from 28 Hackathons where I developed front-end/back-end/mobile apps. Beside developing I did design and project management. But also contributed to some open source projects.  
Some of my highlights:

- **[mockingcase](https://github.com/strdr4605/mockingcase)**  
  I created a *Node.js* package that converts a string to `mOcKiNgCaSe`. Working on this project a learned more about publication of a npm package, software versioning, unit testing, continuous integration, declaration files, documentation, and contribution on open source.
- **[rebble.io](http://rebble.io)**  
  I opened an issue with converting the *SVG static watch logo* into *real-time clock*. After approvement from admins, I edited some SVG paths of the logo and using JavaScript and CSS created an *Easter egg real-time watch*. The hardest part was understanding how SVG works.
- **[saci.md](http://saci.md)**  
  I had to create a simple landing page about bags. I decided to use as many CSS tricks as I can. Also, I created my own grid using *flexbox*. The site has some parallax effect and a lot of CSS animations.
- **[TV8 video player](http://tv8.md/live/)**  
  At one internship my task was a video player for a TV channel in Moldova. We used *VideoJS* framework as a player and I created a custom style using *css/flexbox* on main elements of the player according with clients design.
- **Yopeso Front-end Internship 2016**  
  At the internship I worked on some simple projects. First task was a custom responsive css style using *flexbox* for a simple site. Second task was to aggregate the forum of *Reddit API* using *NodeJS* and extract posts from some topics. Last task was to create a movie catalog site with *ReactJS/Redux* and content from a popular movie API.
- **[JSHacks 2016](https://github.com/jshacks/challenge-debt-md/tree/master/debt-md-front-end)**  
  My team was aggregating a public gov API and my task was the website that displays *external debt of Moldova* in a friendly way. With the help of mentors, I created a small *VueJS* app with *flux architecture* that communicates with our backend. 
- `20.12.2018–PRESENT` **[GoParrot](https://www.goparrot.ai/)**  
  Online Ordering Platform on *Microservices Architecture* build with *Nodejs/Reactjs/MongoDB*. I worked on a service that synchronize database with parteners *APIs* (transforming objects, comparing, merging). Now I work on *Reactjs* app for managing marketing strategy of the company. 
### Other experience
