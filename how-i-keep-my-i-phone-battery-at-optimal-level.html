I don't rush for the latest model and when I buy a phone I hope it to last for at least 4-5 years.</p>
<p>Till recently I owned an iPhone 7 for about 4 years.
And I could own it a bit more, but the battery maximum capacity went down to 65% over years. It could last a maximum of 3 hours of active usage, and never a full day.</p>
<p>The battery died so fast because of incorrect usage of it. In special because the phone was used by my brother in the first year to play games all day.</p>
<p>After I bought a new iPhone 13 mini, I decided to charge the phone smarter to prolong the battery life.</p>
<p>Batteries in smartphones don't like being fully charged or discharged.</p>
<p>But how I could remember when to change it and when to stop changing?</p>
<p>iPhone shortcuts are here to help with this. They can do a ton of stuff.
But for this specific use case, I use shortcuts automation.</p>
<p>I can add automation when the battery reaches a specific level, like below 35% or above 70%.</p>
<p><img src="iphone-battery-shortcut1.jpeg" alt="iphone-battery-shortcut1"></p>
<p>I decided to show a notification and disabled "Ask before Running".</p>
<p><img src="iphone-battery-shortcut2.jpeg" alt="iphone-battery-shortcut2"></p>
<p>Now each time the phone battery drops under 35% I get a notification on my smartwatch and plug the phone to change.
And then the phone was changed to 70% I get another notification and remove the phone from changing.</p>
<p>Probably this technic is not a drastic improvement over <em>"change it at night to 100%"</em>.
But the feeling of prolonging the life of my phone brings joy.
Let's see in 5-6 years what will be the battery health ðŸ˜….</p>
